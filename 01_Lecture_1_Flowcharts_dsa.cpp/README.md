> Lecture 1 – Flowchart Basics

This folder contains my handwritten notes for the first lecture of DSA Learning.
There is no code in this lecture — only concepts and basics.

- What is a Flowchart?

A flowchart is a visual diagram that represents the steps or flow of a process.
It helps us understand the logic of a program before writing code.


- Flowcharts use different shapes to represent different actions:

Oval → Start / End

Parallelogram → Input / Output

Rectangle → Process / Action

Diamond → Decision (Yes/No)

Arrow → Flow of control

- Flowcharts make it easier to:

Visualize logic

Find mistakes early

Plan complex programs

Understand the flow of execution
